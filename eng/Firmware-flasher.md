The firmware download function allows you to update the firmware of the device without a programmer. This function works if the controller has already been [flashed] (Flashing-firmware.md) with FreeJoy firmware using the programmer. The function is available in the "Firmware Programmer" drop-down menu on the right side of the configurator.

If you want to update the firmware, you must:
* Connect the controller to a PC using a USB cable;
* Press the button "Flash firmware";
* Select a .bin file from the archive with the version you need [FreeJoy] (https://github.com/vostrenkov/FreeJoy/releases);
* Press "Ok" and wait until the progress bar reaches 100% and the following message appears:

* After that, disconnect the device from the PC for 5-10 seconds and connect it again.

After that your controller will have a new firmware and you can begin to configure it.
