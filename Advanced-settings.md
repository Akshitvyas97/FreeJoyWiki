There are several advanced settings for the device:

* USB Device name
* Button debounce time
* Toggle press time
* Encoder press time
* USB exchange period

## USB Device name

This name will be shown at system dispatcher of game controllers.

## Button debounce time
 
Debounce time is the minimum time after button press when new press will be detected. It is needed because pushbuttons often generate spurious open/close transitions when pressed, due to mechanical and physical issues: these transitions may be read as multiple presses in a very short time.

## Toggle press time

During this time logical button will be pressed if toggle switch state changed.

## Encoder press time

During this time logical button will be pressed if encoder step detected.

# USB exchange period

Time between two sequential USB packets sent from device to PC.
